U: Unavailable - The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.
-: No reported cases - The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.
N: Not reportable - The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction. 
NN: Not nationally notifiable - This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.
NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.
NC: Not calculated - There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.
Maximum - Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.
* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change.
Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., 
a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category.
Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions.  
For further information on interpretation of these data, see  
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.
†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). 


Notes:

	These are weekly cases of selected infectious 
	national notifiable diseases, from the 
	National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).  
	NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, 
	and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables. 
	Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are 
	subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting.
	Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to 
	these counts as additional information becomes available. 
	Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week.
